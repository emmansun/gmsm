# Security Policy

If you find a significant vulnerability, or evidence of one,
please report it privately.

We prefer that you use the [GitHub mechanism for privately reporting a vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). Under the
[main repository's security tab](https://github.com/emmansun/gmsm/security), click "Report a vulnerability" to open the advisory form.
